# guitar-tab-creator
Program for creating and storing plaintext guitar tabs, written in Python 3.

I tired of attempting to sift through the ad-laden Ultimate Guitar website, so this program should be able to  
store and display guitar tabs as well as import them from plaintext files when it's finished. Editing capabilities  
are planned, as well, possibly with the `curses` Python library.
